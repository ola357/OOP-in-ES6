Object Oriented programming is a programming style which is associated with the concepts like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism.

# Class

A class is a collection of method and variables. It is a blueprint that defines the data and behavior of a type.

# Inheritance

Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows code reusability when a class includes property of another class. 

# Encapsulation

Encapsulation means that we want to hide unnecessary details from the user. 

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either changing how it is done or by changing the parts used to get it done. This can be done in two ways, overloading and overriding.

# Abstraction

Abstraction means, showcasing only the required things to the outside world while hiding the details.
